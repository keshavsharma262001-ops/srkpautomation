A real-time live chat system for WordPress. Provide instant support to your users using Pusher-powered live messaging.

== Description ==

**SRKP Live Support** is a lightweight and powerful real-time chat plugin for WordPress.  
It allows website owners to communicate instantly with their visitors using a clean, responsive chat widget.

The plugin includes:

* Real-time chat using Pusher API  
* Admin dashboard chat management  
* Customizable widget colors  
* Custom support icon upload  
* Header/footer color control  
* Enable/Disable chat switch  
* Mobile responsive floating chat button  
* Secure architecture using WordPress database

This plugin is perfect for businesses that want to improve customer engagement directly from their website with zero coding required.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the Pusher Channels service to deliver real-time chat updates between visitors and the WordPress admin panel.

It sends:

* chat event payloads needed to deliver new messages in real time
* your configured Pusher app credentials from the site settings when the server authenticates API requests to Pusher

It does not automatically create a Pusher account. You must provide your own Pusher credentials in the plugin settings.
